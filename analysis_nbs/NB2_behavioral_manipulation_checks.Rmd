# Set up environment and load in data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
helpers_path = '~/Dropbox/RangelLab/DescribedVsLearned/helpers/'
```

Read in *clean* behavioral data

```{r}
source(paste0(helpers_path,'clean_behavioral_data.R'))
```

- When p of lottery or fractal is 0 do subjects always choose based on the relevant option?

```{r}
clean_beh_data %>% 
  filter(probFractalDraw == 1) %>% 
  mutate(fractalLeftProbAdv = fractalLeftProb - fractalRightProb) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fractalLeftProbAdv, choiceLeft))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(formula = 'y~x', method = "glm", method.args = list(family=binomial), fullrange=TRUE)
```

- Are subjects "learning" fractal values?
- Is there a lottery or fractal bias?
